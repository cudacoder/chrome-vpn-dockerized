# chrome-vpn-dockerized

A simple tutorial project which contains a Luminati server on a Docker container, serving as a proxy server for a Chrome container, which is controlled by PHP WebDriver script.

This project attempts to show how to automate a browser behind proxy.

I would appreciate any feedback on this POC, and would love to hear any opinions on how to improve it.

Thanks!
